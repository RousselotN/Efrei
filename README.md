# Efrei
Hello and welcome to my Efrei's Repos. If you fall there, then it's a good start since you have understand the basis of Computer Science: **Read The Freaking README !!!!**

So this repos is pretty simple, I'll publish all my Efrei-Related work that I want to share publicly. It will be well documented don't worry ;)

The first part will be some gross Python, after, you will enjoy some beautiful C, and maybe C# if I feel like to (C# ftw).

**NOTE 1:**

If you are a Student from Efrei, then don't copy everything from here, you won't learn like that. So go back on your Notepad and work ! However, I clearly invite you to quickly check out how I have done some things if you're stuck. 

**NOTE 2:**

Most of the code are very simple, but there should be some more challenging :)


If you've read the full README, congratulations, now, it's time to code !
