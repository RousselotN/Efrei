 **EfreiZ 0.1 Changelog**
 
 Finally setted up the display !
 Uploaded everything on Github.
 
Current Features :

- Random Zombie movement
- Ability for the user to create their own function in PlayPos.py
- Safe GridEdit function on Board.py, checking with a vectorial representation wether the players move are legits or not
- Basic display thanks to pylab !

What's up next:

- More safety for PlayPos.py, at the moment you can easily change self.x and self.y, and it's not meant to work like that !
- Display Improvement
- Give a brain to those poor Zombies...


I'm thinking about increasing grid's size to 40x40, since the Zombies will soon be able to think...
